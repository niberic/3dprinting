|  Mainboard | TH3D EZBoard Lite v1.1 | https://www.th3dstudio.com/product/ezboard-lite/ | $99.99 | 32-bit board, 2208 TMC Drivers, built-in support for various TH3D add-ons (EZABL & EZOUT). TH3D's online firmware compiler is also very nice. | https://imgur.com/a/1PBHJLG | I had one issue with the EZABL Pro not triggering. Solution was to wire a jumper cable to the board's Servo pins, and adjust the firmware accordingly. |
